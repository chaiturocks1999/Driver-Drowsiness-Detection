# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
This project consists of a system that will accurately monitor the open or closed state of the driver’s eyes in real-time using OpenCV. The system will monitor the driver's eye movements &amp; blink patterns using a camera. A warning alarm will be issued if a prolonged blink is observed.

The code and dataset for the project is huge so I'am sending you the link for the source code and dataset given below :
